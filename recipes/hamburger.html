    <h1>Hamburger Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    This is the ultimate burger recipe. The burgers are packed with flavor and reliably juicy, even when cooked to well-done.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pieces white sandwich bread, crusts removed and cut into ¼-inch pieces</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
        <li>2½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>3 pounds 80 to 85% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3 scallions, white and green parts, very finely sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>8 hamburger buns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high heat.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mash the bread and milk together with a fork until it forms a chunky paste. Add the salt, pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and ketchup and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and scallions and break the meat up with your hands. Mix everything together until evenly combined. Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions and form compact balls. Flatten the balls into ¾-inch patties about 4½ inches across. Form a slight depression in the center of each patty to prevent the burgers from puffing up on the grill.</li>
        <li>Oil the grilling grates. Grill the burgers, covered, until nicely browned on the first side, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip burgers and continue cooking for a few minutes more until desired doneness is reached. Before serving, toast the buns on the cooler side of the grill if desired.</li>
    </ol>
